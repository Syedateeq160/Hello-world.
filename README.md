# Hello-world.
Syed Ateeq,
A student from Pre-engineering background who left engineering just because of his passion in computers
he was always a topper of computer since his primary school 
later in secondary school his overall result was not satisfactory
but he was able to score 84/100 in computer in 9th class (computer) which was among
the highest in class 
but later was forced to change his field,
due to the force of change he stopped using computers and later shifted his system 
into his store room with broken keyboard and mouse.
two years of chemistry actually killed him and because of his aimbitious mind his 
purpoes to study chemistry was nothing but to pass and never involve in any work
related chemistry
as a student of engineering he use to teach his friends of computer science major
(X|-X||) 
just because he loves to learn and teach anything about computers 
he always knows what he has done before the day of result he already knew the 
exact percentage of his which turn's out to be true most of the time 
the outcome was expected and told before to those who forced him to study engineering
after all of the bad days full of anxiety he was to able to pass P.E(intermediate)
later he decided to leave anyone who will force him not to compute
just after passing intermediate he joined a short course which will help him
pass mobile web specialist certification by google from sir syed university karachi
and then he was able to made a philosiphical quote for the long journey he suffered from
"MY LIFE MY RULES"
You can't actually be forced to do something you're not passionate about
later in life you have to do what you love and what you're good at
